   - Part of the Quality Assurance (QA) process.
   - Requires technical expertise and analytical skills.
   - Ensures the game aligns with proposed design and tests all features, compatibility, localization, etc.
   - Testing is necessary throughout the development process but often only utilized extensively at the end (expensive).

3. **Bug Severity:**
   - **A Bugs:** Critical issues that can crash the game.
   - **B Bugs:** Essential issues that require attention but the game remains playable.
   - **C Bugs:** Minor, obscure issues, often more recommendations than actual problems.

   - **Quality Assurance (QA):**
     - Begins once anything is playable, which may be a single level or a subset of the game.
     - Early testing involves a relatively small amount of time.
     - As the launch approaches (crunch time), more testers work full-time, often with overtime.
     - New features and existing ones undergo "regression testing" to ensure stability.
   - **Regression Testing:**
     - Ensures previously tested and working features continue to function after changes.
     - Often overlooked and can be costly as the number of features increases.
     - Proper scheduling is crucial to avoid shipping games with bugs, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential sales failure.

5. **Types of Tests:**
   - **Unit Test:**
     - Checks a single assumption about the behavior of one system.
     - Must be readable, maintainable, and trustworthy.
   - **Integration Test:**
     - Checks that multiple systems are correctly connected and interact properly.

6. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Write a unit test.
   - Watch it fail.
   - Make it pass simply.
   - Refactor.
   - Repeat the process.
   - TDD can lead to 15-30% higher code quality but may increase development time by 10-20%.

7.  **Prons:**
    - faster feedback
    - inherently testable code
    - design of production code from the viewpoint of the calling code

8. **Challenges in Testing with Unity:**
   - MonoBehaviours are difficult to unit test.
   - Requires strategies like Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Dependency Injection to facilitate testing (Obsolete).
   - Testing user interface is challenging: we don't usually test pixels, colors, texts etc.
   - 3D testing?

9. **Unity Test Framework:**
   - Provides tools for creating and running tests within the Unity environment.
   - Allows for the creation of test folders, test scripts, and the execution of tests through the Unity Editor.
   - It is possible to test 3D components
   
### Lessons Learned:
- Properly scheduling and conducting regression testing is essential.
